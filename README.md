Please comment any ideas you may have to improve this mod.

This mod adds another item into the game (the litematica tool) which can be used with litematica instead of the stick. (1.17 can release 1.16 if you'd like, please comment)

please check out litematica: litematica-link

I made this mod because I found it annoying that every time I had a stick in my hand -for example if I was crafting rails- I wouldn't be able to click on the crafting table. this is a small issue that can get really irritating over time so in my opinion this mod is a must-have that I use every time I download litematica.

HOW TO USE:

First you will need to open the litematica menu by pressing "M"
Then click on the "configuration menu" button
On the "generic" tab, search "tool" then replace "minecraft:stick" with "litematicatool:the_stick"
Now you can just exit out and your chosen tool for litematica will be the litematica tool.

(see images for an example)

 

HOW TO CRAFT:

put a stick in the bottom left and any plank on the top right in a two by two crafting grid
